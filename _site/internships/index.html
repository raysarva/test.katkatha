			<h3>Training and Internships</h3>

<p>Katkatha provides professional puppetry training and is one of our main focuses. These are not just one time short expenses but long term sustained training that will create professional puppeteers.</p>

<p>Artists bring various encounters with their art forms and systems of puppetry, new techniques above all, these become exchanges of ideas, academia and technical knowhow. The most valuable result of our internships has been the long term relationships built with puppeteers and artists across fields and regions.</p>

<p>For young artists it is a glimpse into a working puppet theater learning many practical aspects of managing a group, organizing rehearsals and the brass tacks of creating and mounting a show. For an international intern there is the added aspect of experiencing puppetry in India.</p>

<p>In the past interns have chosen two ways of working with us. The first way is working with the group which means joining in every activity of the group as a performer.</p>

<p>The second way is focused on projects as interns join our projects like e.g. Eric Finck from the US became one of the puppeteers and puppet makers in our production Gulbadan during the duration of his 3 month internship. Maggie Winston from Canada brought her own idea and realized a whole show at the Katkatha workshop with help from the Katkatha team to construct her puppets. Frida Leon from Switzerland and (Prohelvetia artist-in-residence), Laura from the UK and Lotte Van Den Berg have all directed shows with Katkatha. Namrta Kaushal from Delhi set up a project for children for learning more about the food that they eat and its journey from the fields to their plate. Some interns have also conducted researches on Katkathaâ€™s community projects like on gender or health like Laura Van Dijk of Belgium.</p>

<p>Any intern follows the work of Katkatha Puppet Arts Trust through its projects, performances, rehearsals and other activities by following a production from beginning to end as an assistant in the production work, or following a community based project. These roles can be mutually agreed on in advance and interns are encouraged to start project based internships with the guidance of Katkatha. This includes creating a show or learning to make puppets and researching on puppetry with the assistance of Katkatha.</p>

<h4>How to apply?</h4>
<p>Applicants need to send their portfolio, a proposal and a statement of purpose (not more than 500 words) to Katkatha.</p>

<h4>Who can apply?</h4>
<p>Any individual may apply for an internship. Katkatha accepts only one intern at a time. Inters are not paid and all short term (less than 6 months) internships have a small fee which is specific to each application. Katkatha will be happy to assist any candidate in any way such as applications for scholarships for supporting their internships.</p>

<p>Interns are responsible for their travel and living arrangements in New Delhi. Katkatha will also assist in finding a place to stay in the city, puppetry resources in the city and with any other aspect of stay New Delhi. Katkatha can sometimes provide support for interns who are from a financially disadvantaged background.</p>

<p>If the intern travels with Katkatha on a project as a collaborator, Katkatha will bear all travel and living costs.</p>

<h4>Duration of Internship</h4>
<p>As in the submitted application.</p>

<p>Internship applicants need not have any experience in puppetry and all applications will be equally considered.</p>
