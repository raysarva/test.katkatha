<h3>Support Our Work</h3>

We need a seed grant to maintain our space and run all our programs. You can donate a portion of the seed money. Or donate the money needed for any one of the programs.

You can help to spread the word to other friends! We welcome you to come to our space.

You can volunteer with us! Our community projects need artists, fund raisers, coordinators and partners.

We have an FCRA- foreign Currency Remittance Account as required by the Indian Government to receive foreign funding. We also have 12A and 80G, so all donations made to us are tax free!
