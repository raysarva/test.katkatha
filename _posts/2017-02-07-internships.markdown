<h3>Training and Internships</h3>

Katkatha provides professional puppetry training and is one of our main focuses. These are not just one time short expenses but long term sustained training that will create professional puppeteers.

Artists bring various encounters with their art forms and systems of puppetry, new techniques above all, these become exchanges of ideas, academia and technical knowhow. The most valuable result of our internships has been the long term relationships built with puppeteers and artists across fields and regions.

For young artists it is a glimpse into a working puppet theater learning many practical aspects of managing a group, organizing rehearsals and the brass tacks of creating and mounting a show. For an international intern there is the added aspect of experiencing puppetry in India.

In the past interns have chosen two ways of working with us. The first way is working with the group which means joining in every activity of the group as a performer.
 
The second way is focused on projects as interns join our projects like e.g. Eric Finck from the US became one of the puppeteers and puppet makers in our production Gulbadan during the duration of his 3 month internship. Maggie Winston from Canada brought her own idea and realized a whole show at the Katkatha workshop with help from the Katkatha team to construct her puppets. Frida Leon from Switzerland and (Prohelvetia artist-in-residence), Laura from the UK and Lotte Van Den Berg have all directed shows with Katkatha. Namrta Kaushal from Delhi set up a project for children for learning more about the food that they eat and its journey from the fields to their plate. Some interns have also conducted researches on Katkathaâ€™s community projects like on gender or health like Laura Van Dijk of Belgium.

Any intern follows the work of Katkatha Puppet Arts Trust through its projects, performances, rehearsals and other activities by following a production from beginning to end as an assistant in the production work, or following a community based project. These roles can be mutually agreed on in advance and interns are encouraged to start project based internships with the guidance of Katkatha. This includes creating a show or learning to make puppets and researching on puppetry with the assistance of Katkatha.
